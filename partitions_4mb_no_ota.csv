# ESP32 Partition Table for Scribe Printer
# 
# IMPORTANT: ESP32 FILESYSTEM NAMING CONFUSION:
# - We use LittleFS as our actual filesystem (see platformio.ini: board_build.filesystem = littlefs)
# - The partition subtype MUST be "spiffs" (0x82) - this is ESP32's standard filesystem partition type
# - The partition name is "littlefs" to match what we actually use
# - This is NOT a mistake - ESP32 requires "spiffs" as subtype even when using LittleFS!
